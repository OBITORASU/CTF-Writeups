# My Collection of CTF and boot2root box writeups

## Description 
This is a collection of some of the interesting challenges I came accross in the CTF events I participated in as well as all the boot2root boxes I have solved on platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. Hopefully I will keep updating this repository with new content for every new event I attend or box I solve. 

## Motivation
Documenting my progress is the clear goal and motivation behind me creating this repository and sharing my approach to problems in CTF events and pentesting vulnerable machines. This would not only help improve my note taking skills but also help me to analyse where I can improve and work on in terms of my hacking skills when I take a look back at this.


## What I provide in this repository?
I will provide links to all the tools and websites I have used while solving CTF challenges/vulnerable boxes. Additionally, I will also provide the scripts I used during the event along with screenshots to make the writeups more lively and easily understandable for anyone reading.
