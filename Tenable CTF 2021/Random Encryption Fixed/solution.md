# Solution for Random Encryption Fixed

## Problem worth 100 points under Coding Section

## Statement:

We found the following file on a hacked terminal:
```
import random
flag = "flag{not_the_flag}"
seeds = []
for i in range(0,len(flag)):
    seeds.append(random.randint(0,10000))

res = []
for i in range(0, len(flag)):
    random.seed(seeds[i])
    rands = []
    for j in range(0,4):
        rands.append(random.randint(0,255))

    res.append(ord(flag[i]) ^ rands[i%4])
    del rands[i%4]
    print(str(rands))

print(res)
print(seeds)
```
We also found sample output from a previous run:
```
[249, 182, 79]
[136, 198, 95]
[159, 167, 6]
[223, 136, 101]

[9925, 8861, 5738, 1649, 2696, 6926, 1839, 7825, 6434, 9699, 227, 7379, 9024, 817, 4022, 7129, 1096, 4149, 6147, 2966, 1027, 4350, 4272] 
```

## Solution:

The code is fairly simple to understand. In the code, initially a ```flag``` variable is initialized with a placeholder flag (not the real flag) then the encryption begins. The code uses the first for loop to iterate over the entire length of the flag, and on every iteration a seed value is generated which is a random value ranging anywhere between 0 to 10000. A list (```seeds```) contains all the randomly generated seed values. Then we come across the second for loop which also iterates for the entire length of the flag, inside it, ```random.seed()``` method is called with the seed parameter which is the seed from ```seeds``` list corresponding to the current iteration number. Now, the third nested for loop is triggered which runs exactly for 4 iterations and appends 4 random integers in the range of 0 to 255 to another list (```rands```). Once, the third for loop has finished execution, we move control back to the body of the second for loop where the a list ```res``` is initialized with ```(ord(flag[i]) ^ rands[i%4])``` where ```i``` is the current iteration number. After this, ```rands[i%4]``` is deleted and the rest of the contents of ```rands``` is printed as a string after which the second for loop finishes its operation. Finally the program prints out both the ```res``` and ```seeds``` list, where ```res``` basically contains the obfuscated flag while ```seeds``` contains the seed values used during execution.

Looking at the output we notice that, the particular value of ```rands``` which was used during the ```^``` xor operation to generate ```res``` had been removed from the it. But, luckily we had access to all the seed values in ```seeds``` as well as the values for ```res```. It is well known that once ```random.seed()``` method is called with a seed value, ```random.randint()``` method will always generate the same numbers from a given range and that is the thing we are going to abuse.

I fired up my text editor and wrote a quick script to recreate the values of ```rands``` which were used during the xor operation. After that all I had to do was xor the known values of ```res``` with the values regenerated for ```rands``` suing the same seed values, to get back the original flag.

Here is the script I used (I have also uploaded it in the repo itself):
```
import random

seeds = [9925, 8861, 5738, 1649, 2696, 6926, 1839, 7825, 6434, 9699, 227, 7379, 9024, 817, 4022, 7129, 1096, 4149, 6147, 2966, 1027, 4350, 4272]
res = [184, 161, 235, 97, 140, 111, 84, 182, 162, 135, 76, 10, 69, 246, 195, 152, 133, 88, 229, 104, 111, 22, 39]
key = []

for i in range(0, len(res)):
    random.seed(seeds[i])
    rands = []
    for j in range(0,4):
        rands.append(random.randint(0,255))
    key.append(rands[i%4])

decodedflag = []
for i in range(0, len(res)):
    decodedflag.append(key[i]^res[i])

for element in decodedflag:
    print(chr(element), end="")
```

On running the script we are presented with our original flag ```flag{Oppsie_LULZ_fixed}```.
